# Objectify

It's an object detection app that uses YOLOv2 Tiny model for prediction of approx. 80 classes present in the coco dataset. The tflite model is integrated in flutter with minimal UI. As of now the app only supports still photos but I am working on detection on realtime video and the model to YOLOv4 tflite.
